electrostatics 0.1
==================

*electrostatics.py* is a python module for electrostatics field line calculations.

Usage of this module is demonstrated via a series of [examples].  The output for each example is given in the [images] directory.  Standard examples are given together with a selection of cases from the excellent [paper] "Electric field lines don't work" by Wolf, Van Hook and Weeks (Am. J. Phys. 64, 1996).

I am pleased to receive bug reports and feature requests on the project's [Issues tracker].
